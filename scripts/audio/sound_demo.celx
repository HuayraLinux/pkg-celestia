--
--  This command accepts 6 arguments:
--  
--  celestia:play ( int [channel], float [volume], float [pan], int [loop], str [filename], int [nopause] )
--  
--  channel - specifies the channel that'll be affected by this call.
--            If not given, will assume the default value of 0, You can provide any number between 0 and 7.
--            Any number out of this range will cause the script to fail.
--
--  volume  - specifies the new volume of this channel. If not given, the volume of the channel will remain unchanged.
--            It starts with the volume 1.0. You can specify any number between 0.0 (minimum, mute) and 1.0 (maximum).
--            If the number given is negative, the value is ignored, and the volume remains unchanged.
--            If the number is bigger than 1.0, the volume will be set to the maximum volume, 1.0.
--
--  pan     - specifies the pan for the channel.
--            If not given, the sound will be centered (default value of 0).
--            The level relationship between the left and right channels must be specified in the range
--            from -1.0 to 1.0. The value -1.0 is only the left channel. The value 0.0 is centered.
--            Value 1.0 is just the right channel.
--
--  loop    - specifies if the sound file will be played in looping or not.
--            If not given, the looping mode of the channel will remain unchanged.
--            It starts with looping off. The value 1 turns the looping on. Any other value turns the looping off.
--
--  filename- name of the file that will be played. If only the file name is specified, then the subfolder "sounds" is searched.
--            I.e. in this case the path is relative to the directory "Celestia\sounds". 
--            If the file is located in a different folder, you must specify the full path to it.
--
--  nopause - parameter that allows a particular sound channel to be paused or not paused on any channel when the spacebar is pressed.
--            Value 0 - allow pause by spacebar, value 1 - disallow.
